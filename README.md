# Elephant Lion Mouse Game
The elephant, lion, and mouse game is my rendition of the classic hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors.” In my rendition of this game "rock = lion", "paper = elephant", and "scissors = mouse." 
## How to play
A simultaneous, zero-sum game, has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss. A player who decides to play lion will beat another player who has chosen mouse, but will lose to one who has played elephant; a play of elephant will lose to a play of mouse. If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. 
## The code
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
