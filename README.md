# Elephant Lion Mouse Game
The elephant, lion, and mouse game is my rendition of the classic hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors.” In my rendition "rock = lion", "paper = elephant", and "scissors = mouse." 
## How to play
A simultaneous, zero-sum game, has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss. A player who decides to play lion will beat another player who has chosen mouse, but will lose to one who has played elephant; a play of elephant will lose to a play of mouse. If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. 
## Code
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Alert methods are used to guide the player through the game. A computer variable assigned to the Math.floor function
provides the computer's choices while the user's input is supplied by an onclick function. The winner is determined by way of a logical-loop function that compares the value of the user against the value of the computer using if and else if statements.
